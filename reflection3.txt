When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-> When you are working with another computer, another person, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-> There might be times where you want your local changes to be different from the Github repository. i.e. working on a new function that's not finished yet

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-> The ability to work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-> I usually use google docs, but that's not good for coding.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
-> Creating a new function, collaboration, etc.
