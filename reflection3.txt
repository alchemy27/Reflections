When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-> When you are working with another computer, another person, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-> There might be times where you want your local changes to be different from the Github repository. i.e. working on a new function that's not finished yet
