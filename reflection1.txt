How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
-> By comparing the two, we can quickly pinpoint the places we changed, and
frequently, the bugs stem from those changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
-> Every programmer makes mistakes, and those mistakes will form bugs. Being able
to more effectively debug your code makes you a more efficient programmer in the
long term.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, versus having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?
-> If machines can detect and save logically, then automatically saving is a good
thing. If it cannot logically save, than manually saving makes the saves more
effective.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in
one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-> Version control systems like git are aimed at programmers. Meanwhile, Google Docs
and others are aimed at people who write essays/take notes. One file is simple and
effective at doing those things.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could
break something?
-> Because you know you can always revert your changes, it makes you less worried
about creating bugs in your code!
